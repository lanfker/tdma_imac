\section {PRKS- Revision Reminder}
\begin{itemize}
  \item No previous $d_0$ concept, which means we do not have to do $d_0$ sampling anymore $\rightarrow$ We can re-define the $ER-INFO-ITEM$ we need to transmit.
  \item GetErInfoItemForLink (.) needs to change
  \item If conflicting set size is 0, do not send. (not a sender). If return value of SenderComputePriority is false and m\_currentTimeslot = 0, do not send (DONE)
  \item If currentTimeslot = 0 or is sending timesot, collect conflicting set and compute priority (DONE)
  \item Note that there is no concept of preempted links anymore. (DONE)
  \item Update next transmission slot information at the receiver side. 
\end{itemize}
